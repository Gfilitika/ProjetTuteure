As opposed to McBits, where a high decryption throughput is achieved by running many decryption operations in parallel, we take a different approach to exploit the internal parallelism in one decryption operation for the use of more applications. As the result, we manage to achieve a slightly better decryption throughput at a much higher security level than McBits. As a minor contribution, we also present a constant-time implementation for encryption and key-pair generation, with similar techniques used for decryption.},

The interest on implementing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, e.g. McEliece, on microprocessor-based platforms has been extremely raised due to the increasing storage space of these platforms. Therefore, their vulnerability and robustness against physical attacks, e.g., state-of-the-art power analysis attacks, must be investigated. In this work, we address mainly two power analysis attacks on various implementations of McEliece on an 8-bit AVR microprocessor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such side-channel attacks are practically evaluated.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in code-based cryptography paved new ways for efficient asymmetric cryptosystems that combine decent performance with moderate key sizes. In this context, Misoczki et al. recently proposed the use of quasi-cyclic MDPC (QC-MDPC) codes for the McEliece cryptosystem. It was shown that these codes can provide both compact key representations and solid performance on high-end computing platforms. However, for widely used low-end microcontrollers only slow implementations for this promising construction have been presented so far. In this work we present an implementation of QC-MDPC McEliece encryption providing 80 bits of equivalent symmetric security on low-cost ARM Cortex-M4-based microcontrollers with a reasonable performance of 42ms for encryption and 251-558ms for decryption. Besides practical issues such as random error generation, we demonstrate side-channel attacks on a straightforward implementation of this scheme and finally propose timing- and instruction-invariant coding strategies and countermeasures to strengthen it against timing attacks as well as simple power analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {With the break of RSA and ECC cryptosystems in an era of quantum computing, asymmetric code-based cryptography is an established alternative that can be a potential replacement. A major drawback are large keys in the range between 50kByte to several MByte that prevented real-world applications of code-based cryptosystems so far. A recent proposal by Misoczki et al. showed that quasi-cyclic moderate density parity-check (QC-MDPC) codes can be used in McEliece encryption - reducing the public key to just 0.6 kByte to achieve a 80-bit security level. Despite of reasonably small key sizes that could also enable small designs, previous work only report highperformance implementations with high resource consumptions of more than 13,000 slices on a large Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA for a combined en-/decryption unit. In this work we focus on lightweight implementations of code-based cryptography and demonstrate that McEliece encryption using QC-MDPC codes can be implemented with a significantly smaller resource footprint - still achieving reasonable performance sufficient for many applications, e.g., challenge-response protocols or hybrid firmware encryption. More precisely, our design requires just 68 slices for the encryption and around 150 slices for the decryption unit and is able to en-/decrypt an input block in 2.2ms and 13.4 ms, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work, we propose two McEliece variants: one from Moderate Density Parity-Check (MDPC) codes and another from quasi-cyclic MDPC codes. MDPC codes are LDPC codes of higher density (and worse error-correction capability) than what is usually adopted for telecommunication applications. However, in cryptography we are not necessarily interested in correcting many errors, but only a number which ensures an adequate security level. By this approach, we reduce under certain hypotheses the security of the scheme to the well studied decoding problem. Furthermore, the quasi-cyclic variant provides extremely compact-keys (for 80-bits of security, public-keys have only 4801 bits).},

  Abstract                 = {The segment of post-quantum cryptography rises its importance with increasing improvements in the quantum computing. Cryptographic post-quantum algorithms have been proposed since 1970s. However, side-channel attack vulnerabilities of these algorithms are still in focus of the recent research. In this paper, we present a differential power analysis attack on the McEliece public-key cryptosystem. We demonstrate that a part of a private key, permutation matrix, can be recovered using the power analysis. We attack a software implementation of a secure bit permutation that was proposed by Strenzke et al. at PQCrypto 2008. The cryptosystem is implemented on a 32-bit ARM based microcontroller. We provide details of the attack and results using power consumption measurements of the device. In addition, we outline a novel countermeasure against the introduced attack. The countermeasure uses properties of the linear codes and does not require large amount of random bits which can be profitable for low-cost embedded devices.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present a novel countermeasure against a simple power analysis based side channel attack on a software implementation of the McEliece public key cryptosystem. First, we attack a straightforward C implementation of the Goppa codes based McEliece decryption running on an ARM Cortex-M3 microprocessor. Next, we demonstrate on a realistic example that using a "chosen ciphertext attack" method, it is possible to recover the complete secret permutation matrix. We show that this matrix can be completely recovered by an analysis of a dynamic power consumption of the microprocessor. Then, we estimate the brute-force attack complexity reduction depending on the knowledge of the permutation matrix. Finally, we propose an efficient software countermeasure having low computational complexity. Of course, we provide all the necessary details regarding the attack implementation and all the consequences of the proposed countermeasure especially in terms of power consumption.},

It is a constant-time implementation for a quasi-cyclic moderate density parity check (QC-MDPC) Niederreiter encryption scheme, and has excellent performance and small key sizes. In this paper, we present a key recovery attack against QcBits. We first used differential power analysis (DPA) against the syndrome computation of the decoding algorithm to recover partial information about one half of the private key. We then used the recovered information to set up a system of noisy binary linear equations. Solving this system of equations gave us the entire key. Finally, we propose a simple but effective countermeasure against the power analysis used during the syndrome calculation.},

Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer.
