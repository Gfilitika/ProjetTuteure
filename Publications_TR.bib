  Abstract                 = {We study incomplete stochastic systems that are missing some parts of their design, or are lacking information about some components. It is interesting to get early analysis results of the requirements of these systems, in order to adequately refine their design. In previous works, models for incomplete systems are analysed using model checking techniques for three-valued temporal logics. In this paper, we propose statistical model checking algorithms for these logics. We illustrate our approach on a case-study of a network system that is refined after the analysis of early designs.},

They are exploiting timing differences on the Patterson decoding algorithm in order to reveal one part of the secret key: the support permutation. The first one is improving two existing timing attacks and uses the correlation between two different steps of the decoding algorithm. This improvement can be deployed on all error-vectors with Hamming weight smaller than a quarter of the minimum distance of the code. The second attack targets the evaluation of the error locator polynomial and succeeds on several different decoding algorithms. We also give an appropriate countermeasure.},

We prove that when the degree of $\sigma(x)$ is sub-linear in the length of the code, the probability that all the coefficients of $\sigma(x)$ are different from zero is extremely high.},

  Abstract                 = {Nowadays public-key cryptography is based on number theory problems, such as computing the discrete logarithm on an elliptic curve or factoring big integers. Even though these problems are considered difficult to solve with the help of a classical computer, they can be solved in polynomial time on a quantum computer. Which is why the research community proposed alternative solutions that are quantum-resistant. The process of finding adequate post-quantum cryptographic schemes has moved to the next level, right after NIST's announcement for post-quantum standardization. One of the oldest quantum-resistant proposition goes back to McEliece in 1978, who proposed a public-key cryptosystem based on coding theory. It benefits of really efficient algorithms as well as a strong mathematical background. Nonetheless, its security has been challenged many times and several variants were cryptanalyzed. However, some versions remain unbroken. In this paper, we propose to give some background on coding theory in order to present some of the main flawless in the protocols. We analyze the existing side-channel attacks and give some recommendations on how to securely implement the most suitable variants. We also detail some structural attacks and potential drawbacks for new variants.},

Cryptographic post-quantum algorithms have been proposed since 1970s. However, side-channel attack vulnerabilities of these algorithms are still in focus of the recent research. In this paper, we present a differential power analysis attack on the McEliece public-key cryptosystem. We demonstrate that a part of a private key, permutation matrix, can be recovered using the power analysis. We attack a software implementation of a secure bit permutation that was proposed by Strenzke et al. at PQCrypto 2008. The cryptosystem is implemented on a 32-bit ARM based microcontroller. We provide details of the attack and results using power consumption measurements of the device. In addition, we outline a novel countermeasure against the introduced attack. The countermeasure uses properties of the linear codes and does not require large amount of random bits which can be profitable for low-cost embedded devices.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present an efficient countermeasure against side-channel attacks on the McEliece public-key cryptosystem. Firstly, we deploy two correlation based power analysis attacks combined with a chosen ciphertext attack targeting the cryptosystem. We demonstrate that a part of a private key (a permutation matrix) can be recovered using the attacks. We show that a revelation of the permutation matrix possess a critical threat to the cryptosystem. We attack two software implementations of a secure bit permutation. The cryptosystem and its variations are implemented on a 32-bit ARM-based microcontroller. We provide details and results of our attacks using power consumption measurements of the hardware. As a main contribution, we present a novel efficient countermeasure against the attacks. The countermeasure (which is a derivate of a masking technique) uses properties of the McEliece cryptosystem in order to reduce the complexity of the masking technique. Our new method does not require a large amount of random bits and it reduces computational time compared to the regular masking technique. These properties can be profitable for low-cost constrained and embedded devices.},

Next, we demonstrate on a realistic example that using a "chosen ciphertext attack" method, it is possible to recover the complete secret permutation matrix. We show that this matrix can be completely recovered by an analysis of a dynamic power consumption of the microprocessor. Then, we estimate the brute-force attack complexity reduction depending on the knowledge of the permutation matrix. Finally, we propose an efficient software countermeasure having low computational complexity.

  Abstract                 = {The profiled side-channel analysis represents the most powerful category of side-channel attacks. In this context, the security eval-uator (i.e., attacker) gains access to a profiling device to build a precise model which is used to attack another device in the attacking phase. Mostly, it is assumed that the attacker has significant capabilities in the profiling phase, whereas the attacking phase is very restricted. We step away from this assumption and consider an attacker restricted in the profiling phase, while the attacking phase is less limited. We propose the concept of semi-supervised learning for side-channel analysis, where the attacker uses a small number of labeled measurements from the profiling phase as well as the unlabeled measurements from the attacking phase to build a more reliable model. Our results show that the semi-supervised concept significantly helps the template attack (TA) and its pooled version (TAp). More specifically, for low noise scenario, the results for machine learning techniques and TA are often improved when only a small number of measurements is available in the profiling phase, while there is no significant difference in scenarios where the supervised set is large enough for reliable classification. For high noise scenario, TAp and multilayer perceptron results are improved for the majority of inspected dataset sizes, while for high noise scenario with added countermeasures, we show a small improvement for TAp, Naive Bayes and multilayer per-ceptron approaches for most inspected dataset sizes. Current results go in favor of using semi-supervised learning, especially self-training approach, in side-channel attacks.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, based on a thorough analysis of the state of the art, we point out a missing solution for embedded devices to secure the syndrome computation. We show that this weakness can open the door to a side-channel attack targeting the secret permutation. Indeed, brute-force attack iterations are dramatically decreased when the secret permutation is recovered. We demonstrate the feasibility of this attack against the McEliece cryptosystem implemented on an ARM Cortex-M3 microprocessor using Goppa codes. We explain how to recover the secret permutation on a toy example. Finally, we propose a promising countermeasure, which can be implemented in embedded devices to prevent this attack.},

  abstract = {The modular exponentiation is crucial to the RSA cryptographic protocol, and variants inspired by the Montgomery ladder have been studied to provide more secure algorithms.
In this paper, we abstract away the iterative conditional branching used in the Montgomery ladder, and formalize systems of equations necessary to obtain what we call the semi-interleaved and fully-interleaved ladder properties.
In particular, we propose two attacker models using fault-injection able to obtain bits of the secret in the semi-interleaved cases (including the Montgomery ladder) but none in the fully-interleaved cases.
We also apply these equations in order to extend the Montgomery ladder for both the semi- and fully-interleaved cases, thus proposing novel and more secure algorithms to compute the modular exponentiation.}
